  "In React Native apps, the application code is executed outside of the " +
  "application main thread. \nThis is one of the key elements of React Native " +
  "architecture and helps with preventing frame drops in cases where JavaScript" +
  " has some heavy work to do. \nUnfortunately this design does not play well" +
  " when it comes to event driven interactions. \nWhen interacting with a touch" +
  " screen, the user expects effects on screen to be immediate. \nIf updates are" +
  " happening in a separate thread it is often a case that changes done in the" +
  " JavaScript thread cannot be reflected in the same frame. \nIn React Native by" +
  " default all updates are delayed by at least one frame as the communication" +
  " between UI and JavaScript thread is asynchronous and UI thread never waits" +
  " for the JavaScript thread to finish processing events. \nOn top of the lag" +
  " with JavaScript playing many roles like running react diffing and updates," +
  " executing app's business logic, processing network requests, etc., it is" +
  " often the case that events can't be immediately processed thus causing even" +
  " more significant delays. \nReanimated aims to provide ways of offloading" +
  " animation and event handling logic off of the JavaScript thread and onto" +
  " the UI thread. \nThis is achieved by defining Reanimated worklets – a tiny " +
  "chunks of JavaScript code that can be moved to a separate JavaScript VM and" +
  " executed synchronously on the UI thread. \nThis makes it possible to respond " +
  "to touch events immediately and update the UI within the same frame when the" +
  " event happens without worrying about the load that is put on the main " +
  "JavaScript thread.";
